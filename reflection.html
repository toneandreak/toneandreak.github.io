        <p>One of the parts that were the most difficult to translate from wireframe to an actual page was to format the pictures and get them in the right place. 
            We had to change the length and the width in order for the pictures to fit the different screens. In addition, we had some problem with the picture links, 
            in order for the pictures to show up on the web page, and we had to upload them multiple times.
            We used the picture attribute for the pictures, in order for them to appear a bit larger when you hover over them, and also to make the picture
            open in a new tab, when clicking on the picture. Originally, the pictures also had a lot of spacing inbetween them, which we also had a bit of trouble removing.

            For the last mandatory assignment, we had a lot of trouble with the navigation bar. 
            This time, with the knowledge obtained from the last assignment, making the navigation bar was not a problem at all. 
            We also used what we learned from the last assignement to changer the underline and color of links, which was something we struggled with this time as well.
            <br>
            One of the most difficult parts of making the page responsive was getting the menu to align in the right place for all the devices, but we eventually managed
            to get it to work for all the devices. In addition, the photoes don't quiet align on a Surface Duo, but it works on other devices.
